# Quantum Computing: Quantum Entanglement and Teleportation 

## Lecture Overview

Welcome to the this lecture in our Quantum Computing course series! In this lecture, we will delve deeper into quantum entanglement, how it works, the maths behind it, teleportation protocol and implementation of the teleportation protocol using qiskit.

## Getting Started with Colab

To follow along and execute the code on your own machine, use the following steps:

1. **Create a Google Account:** If you don't have one already, create a Google account at [Google Account Sign-up](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

2. **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click on the following link to open the Colab notebook for this lecture: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eo7STJ3xxuhyiscq7uKIdwyUg66t6Jv4?usp=sharing).

3. **Run the Notebook:** Once the Colab notebook is open, click on "File" > "Save a copy in Drive" to create your own copy. You can now run the code cells.

## Dependencies

While running the notebooks (colab or ipynb), ensure that you have the required libraries already installed. If not, use `!pip install` within the notebook to install them, as shown in the lecture.
