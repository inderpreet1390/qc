# Quantum Computing Lecture 2: Basic Quantum Circuit with Hadamard and CNOT Gates

## Lecture Overview

Welcome to the second lecture in our Quantum Computing course series! In this lecture, we will build on the knowledge from the first lecture and dive deeper into quantum circuit construction. Specifically, we will create a basic quantum circuit using two qubits and two classical bits. We will apply a Hadamard gate to one qubit, followed by a CNOT gate. Afterward, we will perform measurements on the qubits and simulate the circuit using the QASM simulator for 1000 shots. Finally, we will plot and observe the measurement results.

## Lecture Content

- **`lecture_2.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the second lecture. You will find step-by-step instructions on creating the quantum circuit, performing measurements, running simulations, and visualizing the measurement results.

## Getting Started with Colab

To follow along and execute the code on your own machine, use the following steps:

1. **Create a Google Account:** If you don't have one already, create a Google account at [Google Account Sign-up](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

2. **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click on the following link to open the Colab notebook for this lecture:

3. **Run the Notebook:** Once the Colab notebook is open, click on "File" > "Save a copy in Drive" to create your own copy. You can now run the code cells, experiment, and observe the quantum circuit's behavior.

## Dependencies

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the required libraries already installed. If not, use `!pip install` within the notebook to install them, as shown in the lecture.
