# Quantum Computing Lecture 3: Quantum State Visualization with Hadamard Gate on Bloch Sphere

## Lecture Overview

In this lecture, we will continue our exploration of quantum circuits and gates. We will create a quantum circuit using a single Hadamard gate applied to a qubit. Instead of using a qasm simulator measurement-based approach, we will use a state vector simulator to visualize the quantum state on a Bloch sphere. This visualization will provide insight into the quantum behavior induced by the Hadamard gate.

## Lecture Content

- **`lecture_3.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the third lecture. You will find step-by-step instructions on creating the quantum circuit, applying the Hadamard gate, simulating the state vector, and visualizing the quantum state on a Bloch sphere.

## Getting Started with Colab

To follow along and execute the code on your own machine, use the following steps:

1. **Create a Google Account:** If you don't have one already, create a Google account at [Google Account Sign-up](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

2. **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click on the following link to open the Colab notebook for this lecture: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HdwOChXyZnS-nZfhBrdf90JbP6nfcMkk?usp=sharing)

3. **Run the Notebook:** Once the Colab notebook is open, click on "File" > "Save a copy in Drive" to create your own copy. You can now run the code cells, experiment with the quantum circuit, and observe the quantum state visualization.

## Dependencies

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the required libraries already installed. If not, use `!pip install` within the notebook to install them, as shown in the lecture.
