# Quantum Computing Lecture 4: Quantum Gates and Bloch Sphere Visualization

## Lecture Overview

Welcome to the fourth lecture in our Quantum Computing course series! In this lecture, we will delve deeper into the world of quantum gates. We will explore several key quantum gates, including the X-gate, Y-gate, Z-gate, Hadamard gate, and more. To provide an intuitive understanding, we will use Bloch sphere representations to visualize the effects of each gate on a qubit's quantum state.

## Lecture Content

- **`lecture_4.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the fourth lecture. You will find step-by-step instructions on creating quantum circuits for each gate, applying the gates, and using Bloch sphere visualizations to observe the changes in quantum states. 

## Getting Started with Colab

To follow along and execute the code on your own machine, use the following steps:

1. **Create a Google Account:** If you don't have one already, create a Google account at [Google Account Sign-up](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

2. **Open the Colab Notebook:** Click on the following link to open the Colab notebook for this lecture: [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r3f8xaDLisq8kS41XdvjxcGN6uNqlyVR?usp=sharing)

3. **Run the Notebook:** Once the Colab notebook is open, click on "File" > "Save a copy in Drive" to create your own copy. You can now run the code cells, experiment with different quantum gates, and visualize their effects using Bloch sphere representations.

## Dependencies

While running the notebooks (colab or ipynb), ensure that you have the required libraries already installed. If not, use `!pip install` within the notebook to install them, as shown in the lecture.
